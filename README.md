# UsingNLPforCV
# Animal Image Prediction and Similarity Matching

## Explanation

This project demonstrates how to predict animal types from images and find similar images based on textual descriptions. It utilizes pre-trained models from TensorFlow and Hugging Face Transformers to extract features from images and text, respectively. The system then finds the most similar image based on the provided queries.

## Skills Used

- **Python Programming**: Writing and executing Python scripts.
- **Machine Learning**: Using pre-trained models for image and text processing.
- **Computer Vision**: Handling and processing image data.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Embedding and comparing text descriptions.
- **Data Visualization**: Plotting images for visual confirmation.

## Steps

1. **Setup and Libraries**:
   - Import necessary libraries for data processing, image handling, and machine learning.

2. **Image Classification**:
   - Load a pre-trained ResNet50 model to classify images of animals.
   - Define a function to predict the animal type in an image based on the model's output.

3. **Text Embedding**:
   - Use BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to convert animal names into embeddings.
   - Define functions to compute the embeddings for both image descriptions and query descriptions.

4. **Similarity Search**:
   - Implement a function to find the most similar image based on the cosine similarity between query embeddings and image description embeddings.
   - Test the similarity search with various queries.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Display the best matching image for each query using Matplotlib.
